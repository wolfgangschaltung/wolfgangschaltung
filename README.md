- 👋 Hi, I’m @wolfgangschaltung!
- 👀 I’m interested in creating my own synthesizers and sequencers in Supercollider and monome norns.
- 🐿 I don't have much programming experience, learned some TurboPascal at school in the mid-80s, but forgot everything.
- 🧠 Have four decades of experience in substractive synthesis.
- 🌱 Since Fall '21 I'm learning how to build FM-based synthesizers in Supercollider and controlling them via MIDI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to take courses in Supercollider and Lua for norns.
- 📫 How to reach me: as wolfgangschaltung on scsynth.org and on llllllll.co
